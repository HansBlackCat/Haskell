FOLLOWING THE RELEASE OF MIRANDA BY RESEARCH SOFTWARE LTD IN 1985, INTEREST IN LAZY FUNCTIONAL LANGUAGES GREW. 
BY 1987, MORE THAN A DOZEN NON-STRICT, PURELY FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES EXISTED. 
MIRANDA WAS THE MOST WIDELY USED, BUT IT WAS PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE. 
AT THE CONFERENCE ON FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES AND COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE (FPCA '87) IN PORTLAND, OREGON, THERE WAS A STRONG CONSENSUS THAT A COMMITTEE BE FORMED TO DEFINE AN OPEN STANDARD FOR SUCH LANGUAGES. 
THE COMMITTEE'S PURPOSE WAS TO CONSOLIDATE EXISTING FUNCTIONAL LANGUAGES INTO A COMMON ONE TO SERVE AS A BASIS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH IN FUNCTIONAL-LANGUAGE DESIGN.
